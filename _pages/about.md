Hi! I develop machine learning models for dark matter searches with the [XENONnT](https://xenonexperiment.org/) particle detector in Italy. My advisor is [Christopher Tunnell](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/christopher-tunnell) and I work alongside cool folks both at Rice and around the world in the XENON collaboration.

Currently, I have a few ongoing projects:
    * improve the inference of particle interaction energy inside the detector
    * forecast the correct waveform shapes of large ionization signals
    * compress spatiotemporal data taken by our photosensors

I am also a maintainer of XENONnT's MongoDB setup. Please see my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0001-6655-3685) for a full list of publications.

While I mostly do techy stuff these days, I like writing about different things. I was an [arts editor](https://thetech.com/authors/ivy-li) with the wonderful folks at *[The Tech](https://thetech.com)* and [write](https://napoliion.github.io/writing/) short fiction, poetry, and non-technical [articles](https://www.ricethresher.org/staff/ivy-li) on occasion.
