Hi! I develop machine learning models to be used in the direct search for dark matter by particle detectors such as [XENONnT](https://xenonexperiment.org/). My research is advised by [Prof. Christopher Tunnell](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/christopher-tunnell). I work alongside many awesome folks both at Rice and around the world in the XENON collaboration. I also am a maintainer of XENONnT's MongoDB setup.

Currently, I have a few ongoing projects:
 - improve the inference of particle interaction energy inside the detector
 - forecast the correct waveform shapes of large ionization signals in time-series data
 - compress spatiotemporal data taken by our photosensors with autoencoders

Please see my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6655-3685) for a full list of publications.

Although I mostly work on techy stuff these days, I enjoy writing about non-techy stuff too. In undergrad, I served as a [department editor](https://thetech.com/authors/ivy-li) for MIT's student newspaper *[The Tech](https://thetech.com)* where I covered the arts and culture scene in the greater Boston area. I've also been recognized for my [poetry, fiction, and humanities essays](https://napoliion.github.io/writing/) and write non-technical [articles](https://www.ricethresher.org/staff/ivy-li) for *The Rice Thresher*.
