Hi! I develop machine learning (ML) models to search for dark matter through the experiment [XENONnT](https://xenonexperiment.org/) in Gran Sasso, Italy. I am advised by [Christopher Tunnell](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/christopher-tunnell) and get to work with cool folks both at Rice and around the world in the XENON collaboration.

My ongoing research is in applying ML towards inferring physical parameters like the energy of particle interactions, compressing data to save on storage space, and forecasting the tail ends of signals in our time-series data. I am also a maintainer of XENONnT's MongoDB setup. I try to keep my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0001-6655-3685) up-to-date with my publications. 

Though most of my work these days is machine learning and particle physics, I have never escaped the humanities. I used to be a department editor at [*The Tech*](https://thetech.com/authors/ivy-li) and still write non-technical articles on [occasion](https://www.ricethresher.org/staff/ivy-li).
